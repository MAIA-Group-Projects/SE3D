# Report 1 ‚Äì 27/11/2017

### Ali

- I have delivered 2 knowledge sharing session: ‚ÄúAgile development with Scrum‚Äù and ‚ÄúGitHub for team work‚Äù.
- I have set up my PC with tools and configuration to compile and run the projects.
- I have made recordings of the full step-by-step to achieve that as many faced issues on this part.
- Also, I have started ramping up on Qt GUI apps and PCL.

### Basel

- Read the 3D-korn report quickly.
-	Compiled and run this project (3D-korn) successfully.
-	Read the paper (‚ÄúLeast-Squares Rigid Motion Using SVD By Olga Sorkine-Hornung and Michael Rabinovich‚Äù)

### Fahad

This is my first report for the project so far.i will brie
y discuss all the work
done in the past few weeks and the future work i aim to do.

 Introduction: Our first task was to read and try to understand all the four projects individually,
i managed to retrieve all of them from the git hub depositories.Further more i
went through them trying to understand what was going on. It was quite tough
to run them all since they required specific libraries and i do not have a very
strong programming background but still with the help of my team mate Basel
i managed to.
 Previous weeks: We started by joining a project management website named taiga to manage
our work better and keep a check on where we stand after every week, we also
asked professor Yohan to be included so that he could view our progress.
Using this website we were able to create weekly task and at the end of each
week check if they were completed if not what were the problems we were facing.
Along with this we also installed Skype enterprises to conduct regular meetings
even if one of the memeber was away due to any reason.
 Work Done:
 Downloading and installing all the necessary softwares for running project
 Reading and understanding PCL
 Understanding and working with OpenCV
 Understanding documents provided by professor Cansen Jiang and professor David Strubel
 For next week: For the coming week we will try to test the hardware with our project,to
see the process of data acquisition and propse and way on improving the
process either software or hardware.
 Conclusion: In our next group meeting i will purpose to break up the tasks so that each indi-
vidual memeber has something dierent to work on and more work is achieved
this way.

# Report 2 ‚Äì 04/12/2017

### Ali

- I have ramped up my knowledge on OpenCV and CMake. I will take the initiative to implement them for the project.
- I will dive more on OpenCV to acquire the relevant knowledge for improving registration of data and feature matching.
- I will prepare a demo session to introduce and familiarize the team with OpenCV and CMake.


### Basel

- I have read about Point Cloud Library (PCL) using the article ("A Survey of Rigid 3D Pointcloud Registration Algorithms
	Ben Bellekens, Vincent Spruyt, Rafael Berkvens, and Maarten Weyn") and the documentation on PCL website.
		
- I am going to prepare some code to show to strengthen the knowledge about PCL next team meeting .
